This repository is connected to Andreas Juhl SÃ¸rensen's Master's thesis.

For full context, refer to the dissertation.

The reproduction of documented scheduling results considered in Chapter 3 of the thesis (Case Study I) is contained within two files in this repository:
1. "CS1_Literature.py": Contains the raw code used to obtain the presented results. Can be opened in any Python IDE*.
2. "CS1_Literature_wComments.ipynb": Contains the exact same code but with a detailed description of the procedure, installation, equations etc. used in the modelling. Requires a Jupyter Notebook-compatible IDE, such as Jupyter Notebook or VS Code*.

*For reference, the initial raw code was prepared in Spyder 3, and later converted to the notebook format in VS Code.

The latter simulation of a brewhouse considered in Chapter 4 of the thesis (Case Study II) is contained within the remaining files in this repository.
They are named according to the section they are a part of.

Since the final implementation contains the developments in all of the previous code developments, all comments have been gathered in a single file for the final implementation:

"CS2_Final_wComments.ipynb": Contains the final implementation with a detailed description of the procedure and equations used in every part of the model development. Requires a Jupyter Notebook-compatible IDE, such as Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
