This repository is connected to Andreas Juhl SÃ¸rensen's Master's thesis.

For full context, refer to the dissertation.

The reproduction of documented scheduling results considered in Chapter 3 of the thesis (Case Study I) is contained within two files in this repository:
1. "LiteratureCaseStudy.py" : Contains the raw code used to obtain the presented results. Can be opened in any Python IDE*.
2. "LiteratureCaseStudy_wComments.ipynb" : Contains the exact same code but with a detailed description of the procedure, installation, equations etc. used in the modelling. Requires a Jupyter Notebook-compatible IDE, such as Jupyter Notebook or VS Code*.

*For reference, the initial raw code was prepared in Spyder 3, and later converted to the notebook format in VS Code.
